Description: Create interactive graph visualizations using 'Sigma.js' <http://sigmajs.org/>.  This package is meant to be used in conjunction
    with 'igraph', replacing the (somewhat underwhelming) plotting features of the package.  The idea is to quickly render
    graphs, regardless of their size, in a way that allows for easy, iterative modification of aesthetics.  Because 
    'Sigma.js' is a 'javascript' library, the visualizations are inherently interactive and are well suited for integration
    with 'Shiny' apps.  While there are several 'htmlwidgets' focused on network visualization, they tend to underperform on 
    medium to large sized graphs.  'Sigma.js' was designed for larger network visualizations and this package aims to 
    make those strengths available to 'R' users.
